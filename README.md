The project aimed to develop a system capable of predicting and classifying spam emails using machine learning techniques.
Summary of Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning:
+ Data Cleaning: Conducted the process of cleaning and preparing the dataset, ensuring data quality and consistency.
+ EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Explored the dataset to gain insights, identified patterns, and understood the distribution of spam and legitimate emails.
+ Data Preprocessing: Preprocessed the data by applying techniques such as text normalization, removing stop words, and tokenization to prepare it for model training.
+ Model Building: Utilized various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, logistic regression, or ensemble methods to build predictive models for spam mail classification.
+ Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This helped in understanding how well the models predicted spam emails.
+ Improvement: Experimented with different combinations of algorithms to improve the models' predictive performance.
+ Prediction: Deployed the trained models to predict whether new incoming emails are spam or legitimate, providing an efficient solution for email filtering and security.
### **Overall, by performing data cleaning, EDA, data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, improvement, and prediction, the project successfully developed a system capable of accurately predicting and classifying spam emails using machine learning techniques.**
